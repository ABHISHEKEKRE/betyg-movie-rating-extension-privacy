    <h1>Privacy Policy for Betyg Movie Rating Extension</h1>
    <p>Last updated: July 10, 2025</p>
    <p>
      The Betyg Movie Rating Extension ("Extension") is provided by Betyg.in and is designed to extract movie titles from Google search results and fetch personalized movie ratings and similarity scores from betyg.in based on your username.
    </p>
    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Username: The username you enter in the Extension’s popup, stored in Chrome sync storage to pre-fill the input field across your devices.</li>
      <li>Movie Titles: Extracted from Google search result pages (e.g., Knowledge Panel) to auto-fill the movie input field.</li>
      <li>No Other Data: The Extension does not collect authentication information (e.g., passwords), health information, financial data, personal communications, location, web history, or user activity.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>We use the collected data to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Store your username in Chrome sync storage to pre-fill the username input field for convenience across sessions and devices.</li>
      <li>Send your username and movie titles to betyg.in’s servers to retrieve personalized ratings and similarity scores.</li>
      <li>Display the results in the Extension’s popup.</li>
      <li>The data is used solely for the Extension’s single purpose of providing personalized movie ratings and similarity scores and is not used for any unrelated purposes, such as determining creditworthiness or lending.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Data Sharing and Storage</h2>
    <p>
      Your username is stored in Chrome sync storage, which syncs across your devices linked to your Google account and is encrypted by Google. Movie titles are not stored locally by the Extension but are sent to betyg.in’s servers (<code>https://betyg.in</code>) for processing. Data sent to betyg.in is stored temporarily only for the duration needed to generate ratings and similarity scores and is not retained long-term. We do not share your data with third parties except as necessary to provide the Extension’s functionality.
    </p>
    <h2>GitHub Pages Hosting</h2>
    <p>
      This privacy policy is hosted on GitHub Pages, which may log visitor IP addresses for security purposes. This data is not accessible to Betyg.in. For more details, see <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement">GitHub’s Privacy Statement</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use HTTPS to securely transmit data to betyg.in. Username data in Chrome sync storage is encrypted by Google. However, no data transmission or storage is 100% secure, and you use the Extension at your own risk.
